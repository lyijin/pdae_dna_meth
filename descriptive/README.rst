Scripts to plot descriptive stuff
=================================

These folders contain scripts that do not depend on each other. They're loosely ordered here according to the figures that they produce.

Brief description of subfolder contents
---------------------------------------
- ``pca_and_heatmap/`` plots PCAs and heatmaps that illustrate the methylation patterns of samples relative to each other. Figs produced by this folder include Figs. 1c, 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2.

- ``genomic_context/`` illustrates where the methylated positions lie within the genome. Are they in intergenic regions? Genic regions? For genic--introns, or exons? etc. Supplementary Fig. 1 is produced by code here.

- ``fujairah_vs_abu_dhabi/`` is similar, but shows differences due to location. Produces Fig. 3a.

- ``adult_vs_sperm_vs_planula/`` shows methylation differences between these developmental stages. Produces Figs. 4a, 4b.
